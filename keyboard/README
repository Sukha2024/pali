To use the pli-latn keyboard layout simply:
1. Copy the file into /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols
2. Add the line:
   pli-latn        Pali
   into these files:
   /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
   /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst
3. Restart the windowing system (usually just logging out and back in
   should be enough.
4. New keyboard layout should now be visible i your system. Different
   window managers have different keyboard layout widgets - check there.
5. If you still can't choose pali layout, remove xkb cache files
   (backup them first, just in case!):
   /var/lib/xkb/*.xkm

   OR

   On dpkg based systems (debian, ubuntu, etc.) you might try this instead:
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data
